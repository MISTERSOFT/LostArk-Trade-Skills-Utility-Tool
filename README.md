# Lost Ark trade skills utility tool
A Lost Ark trade skills utility tool using Python, OpenCV and Tesseract OCR.

Fishing in Lost Ark is one the most annoying/boring things you have to do in the game. But some of us may don't have time to farm fish and prefer do raids for golds (understandable) and do Una tasks instead. That's how this utility comes in.
